I have decided to use the OpenWeatherMap API. I chose this API because it offers an extensive range of historical, forecasted, and current weather information for many different places throughout the globe. Many people find weather information useful, whether they need to plan trips, engage in outdoor activities, or just keep up with local conditions. The OpenWeatherMap API is also appropriate for integration into a tiny web application since it provides an easy-to-use interface with enough documentation.
